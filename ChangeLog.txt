When going from MORNING to DAY, the lights-off commands never gets fired if the sensor is getting 
  activated more often than the lights off-time. This problem has been temporary fixed by
  setting timeBeforeDecreasing to 300 seconds (5 minutes) when the day-periode is DAY - meaning,
  that the light is forced off after five minutes.
When changing away from NIGHT mode, state.schemaOff is then set to off regardless of the value
  in state.schemaOffTime. This fix the issue where the schema doesn't go live when changing
  to MORNING mode.
state.schemaOffTime, used to re-activate light during NIGHT mode, have been changed to 8 hours - which is equal
  to never reactivate until the mode is changed.

  Introduced outlet switches.
  "Select the bulbs used to state the ownership" is no longer mandatory. If ownership is not set, 
    then the app will just think it always owns the lightbulbs.
	  Also if ownership is not set, the app will try to find current level from other devices added.
